# beyazids-horiseon
Social media marketing for "Horiseon" by Beyazid Yunus.
Github was being weird. My website was not working after some troubleshooting.
I was then instructed by Michael Baynon to upload images of my code to my readme file and that he would make sure I would not be penalized for the website not working.
